This weightage is also indicative of the academic expectation that includes in-class contact and self-study outside class hours.\\n\\nLectures and Tutorials:\\n\\n1 credit 1 contact-hour per week (50 minutes) 2-3 hours expected self-study time outside class for every contact hour\\n\\nLaboratory:\\n\\n1 credit 1-2 hour lab session per week 2 credits 3-4 hour lab session per week 3 credits 5-6 hour lab session per week 4 credits 7-8 hour lab session per week\\n\\nA student is expected to spend 1 hour outside the lab per lab hour, for preparation, self-study etc.\\n\\nChapter 2. Course Structure, Credit System & Evaluation\\n\\n2.2. Credit System\\n\\nCredit structure of each course is given in L-T-P-C form (e.g. 2–1–0–3). The numbers corresponding to L, T and P denote the contact hours per week for Lecture, Tutorial and Practical/Practicum respectively, and that of C denotes the total number of credits for that course in a semester.\\n\\nExamples -\\n\\nCE511 (3-0-0-3) This course has a total of three credits and all are to be delivered through 3 lectures (50 min each) per week. CE556P (0-0-4-2) This course has a total of two credits and all are to be delivered through 4 laboratory/practical sessions (50 min each) or one session of about 3-3.5 hours per week etc. ME513 (3-0-2-4) This course has a total of four credits and they are to be delivered through 3 lectures (50 min each) and about 2 hours of laboratory/practical sessions per week. ME517 (3-1-0-4) This course has a total of four credits and they are\", metadata={'source': './data\\\\UG_Academic_Handbook _2022_23.md', '_id': '42a762d6275548249bccdc0c7cd50a54', '_collection_name': 'document_embeddings', 'relevance_score': 0.817571759223938}),\n",
