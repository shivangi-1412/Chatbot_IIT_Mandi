Core courses almost done by 5th semester.

With the knowledge of core curriculum, students can take advanced DE and FE in Semesters 6-8.

Given that students get busy with job interview preparation, Semesters 6-8 are less loaded than the first 5 semesters.

Given that students get busy with job interview preparation, Sems 6-8 are less loaded than the first 5 semesters.

There is a room to take 3 extra credits per semester to catch-up with any backlogs.

# Notes and potential issues

Notes

This is a suggestive template, as the students are free to take courses as they like as long as the dependencies are maintained and the total number of credits are completed.

It is suggested that the order suggested for DC must be maintained as they will be offered in the semesters mentioned: Free and Discipline electives can be taken in any order.

All ME and EN courses will be Discipline Elective courses. If the FAs feel fit, they can suggest (with reasoning) to add a non-ME and non-EN course into the DE list.

Potential issues

Will the proposed structure allow scope for various Minors?

Can the students fit in a 6-month internship with this structure?

Any other issues?
