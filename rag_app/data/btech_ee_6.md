Academic courses offered by IIT-Mandi for the B. Tech. / B. Tech. (Honors) program are classified as Institute Core (IC), Discipline Core (DC), Discipline Elective (DE) and Free Elective (FE) courses. As per IIT Mandi, a student must complete minimum credit requirements of 160 credits for regular B. Tech. and 172 credits for the B. Tech. with Honors. Hierarchically, IC courses provide a broader view of all engineering disciplines and IIT Mandi believes in making this learning process instrumental. Here, students are conceptualized with the fundamentals of these essential courses via theoretical approach and by conducting methodically structured experiments for same. The majority of these IC courses are offered during 1st and 2nd semesters of B. Tech. program. During the initial phase of this program, students are exposed to a flagship course of IIT Mandi, referred as Reverse Engineering, where students are instructed to dismantle the commercial appliances and reconstruct them back to a working state. This inculcates a spirit of learning-by-doing which is a hands-on approach of understanding the subjects. It also makes them realize that they need to interact with their surroundings to adapt and learn.

The DC courses are more focused towards electrical-engineering subjects where the students are escorted deeper into core concepts. These are the fundamental knowledge that every engineer must have on their fingertips when they are working or pursuing higher studies. These DC courses are well structured and cover a wide range of areas in electrical engineering. They are offered between 3rd – 5th semesters of the B. Tech. program along with a few IC & DE courses.

From 4th semester onwards, DE courses are offered to the students where they can opt for any of these courses with their own interest or by consulting with their faculty advisor(s). The list of DE courses is presented below in this document and is 3 – 6 level courses. They are advanced subjects designed to render in-depth understanding of specific areas in electrical engineering. DE courses have a wide variety and their contents are of state-of-the-art standard. These are the subjects which give them an edge while applying for the core-company jobs and make them highly skilled assets of an organization.

In the 4th semester, students are offered with the design practicum course which is inspired by the practicum-based learning. Here, students are segregated into groups where each group contains students from various disciplines like computer science, electrical, mechanical, civil, physics etc. Each group is supposed to carry out an interdisciplinary project that solves real-world problems of society and its cost is fully sponsored by IIT Mandi.

In this era of interdisciplinary technology, students are encouraged to take courses apart from the core electrical engineering. These are FE courses and are offered from 6th semester onwards. Once again, the students can register for these courses based on their interest or the advice taken from faculty advisor(s).

Another flagship practicum course called Interdisciplinary Socio Technical Practicum is offered during 6th semester. This course provides an invaluable opportunity for students to understand the real problems of the local surrounding and come up with feasible solutions. In addition, students from IIT-Mandi collaborate with the international students while executing this course. It provides invaluable experience for them to work in a multinational culture.

Eventually, the students are given an optional choice in 7th - 8th semester to carry out a major technical project (MTP) under the supervision of a faculty member. It is a year-long project taken by B. Tech. students in their fourth year. The MTP is a capstone task which builds upon the previous three years of study taken by a B. Tech. students.

# Objectives
