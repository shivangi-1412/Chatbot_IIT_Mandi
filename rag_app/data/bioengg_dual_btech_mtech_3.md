Integrated Dual degree (IDD) B.Tech and M.Tech in Bioengineering

Preamble to the programme:

Bioengineering integrates physical, chemical, mathematical, computational and life sciences with core engineering principles driving the technologies towards advances and applications in health, environment, agriculture, energy etc thereby improving the quality of life. It creates knowledge from the molecular to organ systems levels, develops materials, devices, systems, information approaches, technology management, and methods for assessment and evaluation of technology, for the biological applications. The discipline of bioengineering has evolved drastically over the past 50 years, seemingly encompassing all fields that include bioelectric phenomena, bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomechanics, bioinstrumentation, biosensors, biosignal processing, biotechnology, computational biology, medical imaging, etc. The B.Tech and M.Tech dual degree programme on Bioengineering strives to train the students in the field of physical, chemical, mathematical and biological sciences together with engineering principles for inculcating knowledge enabling them in developing and deploying Bioengineering technologies in various fields.

MTech allows the Bioengineers to specialise in four advanced focused areas:

- a) Biomedical Engineering aimed at gaining expertise in the areas of diagnostics, therapeutic and assistive support for healthcare applications.
- b) Agricultural Automation Technology aimed at providing automation and assistive support to agricultural practices.
- c) Environmental Science and Engineering aimed at training bioengineers to develop environment friendly processing technologies involving bio-organisms.
- d) Computational Bioengineering aimed at both developing algorithms and models to understand biological systems and processes.

The curriculum will impart training to budding students that will cater to the requirements of Bio-based industries. At IIT Mandi, a student needs to complete 160 credits for B.Tech in 4 years and 70 credits for M.Tech in two years. The integrated dual degree programme in Bioengineering allows the students to go through a rigorous framework of core courses at Bachelors and Masters level and a comprehensive and detailed project and dissertation work which allows a student to graduate in 5 years with a B.Tech-M.Tech integrated dual degree earning 206 credits.

Dear Dr. Shubhajit,

Congratulations on thinking about Bioengineering at IIT Mandi. It is certainly a major in very high demand. I have some quick comments:

- Introduce at least one course per semester related to biomedical engineering
- At the moment there is no biomedical engineering course in semester 1 and 2
- Like MBBS 1st year, physiology must be taught in the 1st year (may be 1st semester and 2nd semester courses as Physiology-I and Physiology-II, respectively
- Anatomy as a separate course can come in semester III and Systems Biology in semester 4
- Semester V is very heavy, full of biomedical engineering courses. I do not know what you will cover in Computational Biology, however Biostatistics must be a separate course. So, you might want to move Biomedical Measurements and Instrumentation to the second year (semester 4?)
- Ethical Issues in Biomedical Engineering must be taught at an early stage (may be semester V), because this is the course which really inculcates the feeling of biomedical engineering to students. Otherwise, they would never understand the key difference between biomedical engineering and other engineering streams.
- Biomedical Technology
- What is the difference in the course contents between Control Systems and Biomedical Systems? Control Systems in biomedical engineering cannot be cast as the typical course for electrical/electronics engineers. It must be Biomedical Systems and Control (refer to IIT Madras's course for MTech students).
- What are you covering in Medical Imaging? I recommend you make it Medical Imaging Systems (X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, Ultrasound). I am teaching this course at the moment in Macquarie.
- I do not see any explicit course in Medical Image Processing (which is the expertise of Anil and others).

Other specializations in your MTech are not my area, so I cannot comment on them.

Hope my comments were helpful. Happy to help more if you are planning to work on these comments.

With warm regards,

Dr. P K Roy  Sat, Dec 8, 2018, 8:02 AM to src

Dear Dr Roy Chowdhury,

Thank you for your mail about your new schema for the IDD Bio-Engg. program.

The proposal indeed looks attractive.

I think some points might be considered.

Recently, after the breakthroughs of the international initiatives as the Human Genome program and the Personalized Medicine Program, the discipline of Bio-Engineering has spawned such that there is equal importance to all the 3 components of the discipline: Biology, Medicine, Engineering.

It would be nice to give also give a good emphasis to both Biology as well as to Medicine (particularly diagnostic and therapeutics) aspects right from the initial year of your program. The program appears more loaded towards the "Engineering" fields. I think shifting some programs between the years may be needed, which I mention later.

Your effective teaching program is 4 years (the 5th year is for only MTech thesis).

In that teaching program's first 50% duration (i.e. the first 2 years), the course deals mainly with Engineering and allied fields, as Basic engineering/I.T./Computing/Physical sciences,. Basic Biology and Basic Medical areas may now be considered. From the bioscience perspective, in the first 2 years, you have only 2 biology subjects, buth they are more technology/mathematics oriented, as Bio-"technology", and Systems Biology (this field is mostly Bio-mathematics).

It may be preferable to have courses in core biology in the first 2 years from the beginning, and at least 1 biological subject every semester. Is it possible to have a foundational course on "Molecular Biology and Genetics" in your First year (Genetics, DNA, RNA and Ribosome machine is very exciting to younsters I find, if put from an "algorithm' and "machine" perspective). Also, is it possible to shift your "Cell biology and cellular processes" subject to the Second year (Medical students do similar courses in first year, after school).

We are having the Indian Academy of Neuroscience annual conference, in AIIMS Delhi, next November, 2019 (we organized this years conference here at BHU here last month). Your faculty and students are welcome to participate (http://neuroscienceacademy.org.in/joinacademy.php#)

Hope this may be useful to you.

It is a very good initiative that you are doing.

All the best,

Nice Curriculum designed, congratulations.

Few minor suggestions:

V, VI semesters can have few specialization labs such as (a) Biomedical Instrumentation Lab, Biomechanics Lab,
(b) Systems Biology Lab, Omics Lab, (c) Biosensors Lab, Nanotechnoligy lab.

Can you think of adding a biomaterials course.

Can you think of adding a ANalog and Digital Circuits course

Can you think of adding a modeling and simulation course

In summary, I am for master level programme alone, with various specialization as designed.

Hope this is useful.
