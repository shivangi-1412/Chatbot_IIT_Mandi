# General Engineering: Structure

A General Engineering program is an interdisciplinary course that provides students with a strong foundation in theoretical and practical engineering.

Students learn the basics across various engineering streams in the first two years.

For the final two years, they select a specialization and spend one year with a partner institute or company to gain in-depth expertise in their chosen field.

The students will be offered a degree: BTech in General Engineering with a specialization in ABC.

Students also have the choice of not taking any specialization.
