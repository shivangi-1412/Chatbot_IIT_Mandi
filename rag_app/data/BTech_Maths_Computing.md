# Indian Institute of Technology Mandi

175075 Technoloa Kamand; Himachal Pradesh 175075

B. Tech. in Mathematics and Computing in School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (SMSS)

# I. Program Description:

The Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program in Mathematics and Computing is a comprehensive course that integrates the principles of mathematics and computing. This program is designed to equip students with a strong foundation in mathematics, computing, and computational thinking, enabling them to develop and apply analytical and problem-solving skills in a variety of fields in science and engineering. The aim of this program is two-fold, one to provide strong mathematical background for strong logical thinking, and other to prepare students for strong computing skills. The mathematics part will also give them strong foundation which enable them to be leader in the field. The program is design in such way that after important foundational courses, students can choose courses as per their interest in a particular domain. The program aims to produce graduates who are well-versed in a broad range of mathematical and computational concepts, techniques, and tools. With the help of these skills, students can handle complex real-world problems. It will also enhance the ability of the students looking for solving new challenges in the society. With a focus on both theoretical and practical aspects of mathematics and computing, this program prepares students for a wide range of careers in industries, academia and research & development.
