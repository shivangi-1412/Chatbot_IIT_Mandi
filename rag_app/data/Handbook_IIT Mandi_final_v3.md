ForewordDear Students, It is a pleasure to welcome you all to this picturesque campus of IIT Mandi situated in the lap of Himalayas. I am proud of each one of you as you selected IIT Mandi to pursue your professional career. I also congratulate all your parents who supported you in this decision making. Now it is time for action. Every moment of your stay here must be associated with positive energy, creative thinking, transformative attitude and holistic lifestyle that will make you the person of character and a leader in your chosen field. This requires a BIG dream that you build for you based on your nature aided by your hard work and dedication. While you go through the usual schedule of class room teachings along with the rigors of quizzes, assignments, lab sessions and other evaluations, you need to be involved in out-of-the-box thinking as well. The globe is in a cross-road with global warming, environment pollution, and the perceived threat of possible extinction of human race. Such a situation naturally impels us to come out of your selfish goals and to embrace the Universal brotherhood by becoming empathetic and mindful of social needs. In this context, each one of you can become the instrument of change with the holistic use of science and technology. Instead of borrowing western ideas, lets be indigenous by appealing the spirit of this great nation. To embark upon such a challenging journey, we are ensuring that you feel this campus as home away from home. There are many support systems for you in terms of staff at dean, students, faculty advisor, student mentors and caring health centre. As you settle in the campus, you will get many opportunities to lead, participate and run many Institute activities.

As IIT Mandi as a community strives hard to become one of the best, you will also play a very important role in this endeavor. There will be endless opportunities for each one of you as innovators and researchers. Remember a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Let us walk this journey side by side with each other until we help you realize your career aspirations. I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all of you. Prof. Laxmidhar Behera Director

Message from Dean (Students)

Dear IIT Mandi Students,

Welcome to the institute! This handbook is designed to serve as a guide to the campus for the newly joined students. The institute has lots of resources to explore about it, and the presented book is one of them. The book may act as an initial learning of the institute in terms of academic- and student-activities/facilities.

IIT Mandi is not producing just an engineer, however, determined to produce an all-rounder technocrat with exposure to academic as well as non-academic activities viz. the cultural, the technical, the literary and the sports. The institute caters students with some of the unique activities such as hiking, trekking and mountain-biking. You should use every resource very carefully and with a sense of the responsibilities.

Prof: Hitesh Shrimali

The book briefs about available facilities in terms of the academic, the hostels, the canteens, and the student gymkhana. The book has also enlisted some of the frequently asked questions which can be beneficial to understand the system at ease. It also includes details of many issues you may encounter in the institute. The useful contact details of the key people such as the gymkhana presidents, the useful office- and hostel-staffs under the deanery of the student affairs, are herewith mentioned.

I wish you fruitful studies and student-life at the campus. I believe that you will contribute to the development of the institute as well as the nation, while becoming a responsible citizen of India.

Prof. Hitesh Shrimali

The Gymkhana along with the various representatives of the clubs and their respective faculty advisors play a significant role in this ‘learning outside the classroom’.

As the highest Student Body of an institute in its developing stage, we strive to grow and develop to become a Self-Governing body that is Independent, Innovative and Irreproachable.

HOSTELS

It is practice at IIT Mandi to name the hostels after the lakes of Himachal. The ten hostels spread over campus provide students reasonable accommodation and each of them has several study rooms and a common room:
---
Each hostel has several study rooms and to the Medical Unit in the south campus. A common room, which is equipped with LCD TVs, TT table, electric kettles, ironing boards and boxes, microwave oven etc. Laundry rooms are equipped with washing machines (fully automatic for those who prefer to exercise solely the index finger). You may receive visitors in the common room till 10:00 p.m. on a given day. Depending on the room size we have single, double and triple occupancy rooms. Each student is given an almirah, spacious enough to secure all belongings, a table and chair. All hostels have internet facilities, and we hope that internet services will keep improving.

Hostel Complexes

It is practice at IIT Mandi to name the hostels after the lakes of Himachal.

Girls Hostels

Renuka: Renuka is made up of B3, B4 & G3 (South Campus) and an annexe next to the Medical Unit in the south campus. The annexe is a renovated building, with a clutch of new rooms built around the shell of an old building - the architectural equivalent of old wine in a new bottle.

GauriKund: Situated in the north campus, Gauri Kund hostel comprises B16, B21, B22 and B20 buildings.

Chandratal: The most recently built girls hostel B8 of IIT Mandi lies parallel to the banks of Uhl river. It is a multiblock hostel with high capacity.

Boys Hostels

Prashar: B1, B2, and G2 form Prashar hostel. Though ‘B’ does not stand for boys, they are meant for boys only. The construction has been done in such a way that the rooms have excellent insulation, i.e., they remain really cool during hot summers and fairly warm during cold (very cold!) winters.

Nako: It was the first student settlement on Kamand campus, comprising four blocks known popularly as Bamboo Barracks. After the Nako hostel in Sauli Khad in Mandi town was shifted to Kamand campus in 2014, the bamboo blocks were renamed Nako. Today, Nako comprises two of the most comfortable buildings in south campus B6, B7 & G4. The students were shifted on April 25, 2015 to the new G4 block on Kamand campus - a historic milestone in campus history! For the gender sensitive, ‘G’ stands for Gypsum, the construction material used and not for girls!

# Suvalsar

Suvalsar, the first hostel for boys, was earlier in Mandi transit campus next to the academic block and accommodated the first year students till the 2013 B.Tech. batch. Building B5 is called Suvalsar hostel.

A Word on the Surroundings

IIT Mandi, located in one of the most picturesque, unspoiled areas of rural Himachal, features the majestic Himalayas, lush mountains, and silvery streams cutting through the confined valleys.

In the morning, the sound of birds fills the hillside. During early spring, you get to witness the breathtaking display of wild rhododendrons. Adding to all this is the soft rustle of river Uhl, flowing down to join the Beas, enticing you to take a swim in its icy cold waters. However, it is never safe to get in these tricky mountain rivers.

Then there is the majestic peak of Khani separating the two campuses. Begin your journey from one campus and end it in another. Another place you can trek to nearby the campus is the Griffin peak. The beautiful view of both the campuses from the top is completely worth the tiring trek.

Present right next to campus is the Kamand village, giving a glimpse of the local Himachali life. During the night, with its moonlit clear skies, it provides a perfect escape from the busy college life. Simply stroll along the road while listening to the river run directly below you to lift your spirits.

Nature‘s Palette

IIT Mandi campus is blessed with rich flora and fauna. The floral rainbow of nature is seen throughout seasons. Throughout the year, your senses will be enticed by beautiful flowers, fruits and berries growing on our campus. In summer nature treats you to Raspberries, Mulberries (found near the Cedar mess and A5 building), Kaafal, Kashmal (a black color fruit seen near the roadside), Figs, and the like. As residents of pristine Kamand valley you would see beautiful and useful flowers. As summer sets in, the red colored Simbal and beautiful Erythrina blossoms and looks like ‘ Kumkum’ on the valley’s forehead. The crisp pinewood air will keep your lungs healthy and fresh. You could visit the Botanical garden and try to identify some of the trees planted.

Other than bestowing us with flowers, fruits and fresh air, the trees and plants provide habitat for a vibrant bird and insect community. You can easily spot birds like hawk, cuckoo, magpie etc. If you are a keen observer you would notice the seasonal variation in the avian residents and the occasional visits from migratory birds. Some days you may be treated to the fascinating spectacle of huge birds encircling the campus. These are The Great Himalayan Griffon, scavenging birds of an endangered species. Leopards are also reported in the forests of Kamand. But always remember that nature loves harmony and animals only attack in self-defense when their territory is invaded.

Tip: Get up early in the morning, pick up your camera and just go around the campus. Nothing will be more rewarding!

# SPORTS

Sports can be a co-curricular as well as extra-curricular activity. In fact, in the first year, you are expected to choose from among NSO, NSS and Hiking & Trekking. You are expected to put in forty hours of participation in any one of these activities. NSO encourages athletics, football, cricket, hockey, volleyball, table tennis, lawn tennis, badminton, and basketball, and it has dedicated coaches for most games. The Campus has facilities for all these games including tennis, swimming and squash.

You can also use the NSO route to get into one of the IIT Mandi sports teams and take part in the annual Inter-IIT Games, held usually at one of the bigger IITs. IIT Mandi teams have started making a mark at these games.

# Gym & Fitness Club

The Institute has a well equipped gymnasium. Get to use it often and keep fit! You may also try aerobics or yoga at the Fitness Club in the Lounge or sports complex in the south or north.

# Jogging, Walking, Cycling

The South and North Campuses have beautiful roads snaking through to nearby villages. Enjoy the scenic splendor as you walk to it, or jog up to ‘Peepul Point’ (2.8 km from the Director’s Office). Of course, you can also go to nearby villages from the north. And if you are lucky, as you most certainly will be, you can join Professor Gonsalves, Mrs Gonsalves and Rusty on their regular constitution. You can lend yourself a cycle from the mountain biking club and huff and puff your way down to one of the neighboring villages.

[Insider Tip: Don’t mistake the dogs on campus for strays. These are the friendly, tail-wagging Bhutias of Himachal, which invariably accompany you - give you safe passage - and hand you over to the next Bhutia at the edge of its territory, the canine sporting equivalent of passing the baton.]

# Hiking and Trekking

The spirit of adventure beckons you. Join the H & T club and explore the great Himalayan outdoors! Places like Prashar, Rewalsar, Kamand, Manikaran, Bijli Mahadev, Barot etc., are ideal for trekking. With the Director and many faculties themselves having keen interest in hiking, the club arranges trips to various places on a regular basis. Students have trekked to Beas Kund, Prashar lake, Naina Devi Temple, Shikari Devi Temple, Bijli Mahadev, Kamrunag Temple and to the hilltops adjoining the campus.
