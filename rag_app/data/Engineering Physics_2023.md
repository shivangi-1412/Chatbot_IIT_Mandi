|IKSI81| |Ikshma Course| | |3-0-0-3| | |
|ICXXX| |Foundations of Design Practicum| | |1-0-6-4|Only one course (FDPIKS) needs to be taken by students. They may take the other course in the End semester. The total credits may be 18 if HSS course is not taken by the student. Accordingly, the subsequent number would change. The compulsory 12 credits from HSS need to be completed by Sem VI. IKS and FDP may run in both semesters. Half of the batch does one course while the other half of the students do the other course. In the second semester, this will be swapped. Accordingly, students may do 18-22 credits.| |
