# B.Tech. in Engineering Physics at IIT Mandi

Preamble to the program:

Engineering Physics (EP) at IIT Mandi is a unique program, which is designed to prepare graduates with a rigorous foundation in Physics along with Engineering in order to tackle today’s technology challenges. EP will enhance the cross-functionality and bridge the gap between pure science and traditional engineering disciplines which conventionally are pursued independently. This is necessary because in today’s world major scientific and technological breakthroughs happen in a multi-disciplinary environment where scientists from pure science work along with engineers. It is, therefore, highly important to inculcate both scientific and technological aspects, and the EP programme will serve this purpose.

The curriculum for EP at IIT Mandi introduces students to a wide variety of fields in pure as well as applied Physics. The core courses cover basic areas in Physics, such as Quantum Mechanics, Condensed Matter Physics; as well as basic courses in Mathematics and Engineering. In addition to the compulsory courses, students will complete a certain number of elective courses in Physics intended to provide a good exposure in various directions in both theoretical and applied Physics. The vision is to cater to and enhance the curiosity of students with varied interests in the field. Besides, a number of courses in other branches of science and engineering, along with humanities and social sciences, will also be available as electives. This will allow students to explore their areas of interest. If a student is inclined towards electrical engineering, s/he can take the requisite number of courses/credits in that program and get a minor.

Interdisciplinary areas in physical sciences and engineering, like Quantum technology, Photonics, Nano-electronics and Artificial Intelligence, promise to become dominant in the 21st century. EP that teaches science underlying engineering will prepare students to apply Physics to tackle these 21st century engineering challenges and vice-versa. Additionally, EP will also prepare students to pursue an advanced degree in Physics as well as engineering.

Objectives of the program

After the completion of the degree, students would

- be prepared with a varied range of expertise in different aspects of physics and engineering
- acquire solid understanding of both the theory and experimental physics to take up the challenging future problems.
- be better trained professionals to cater the growing demand for interdisciplinary professionals with engineer cum physicist in industry.
