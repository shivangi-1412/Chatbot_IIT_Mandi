# Motivation

The development of a country primarily depends on the availability of physical infrastructure and facilities for civil society. These Infrastructures play a vital role in the improvement of the country’s economic growth and standard of living. The adequate infrastructure in the form of road and railway transport system, ports, power plants, airports and their efficient working is also essential for integration of the country’s economy with other economies of the world. A civil engineer plays an important role in developing and maintaining these infrastructures. Our country, which is investing significantly to improve its infrastructure facilities like metro rails, smart cities, express ways, highways, ports, airports, dedicated freight corridors, etc. to cope up with its ever-increasing needs, requires high quality civil engineers who can handle these specific projects. As one of the premium institutes in India, IIT Mandi offers both UG and PG programmes in civil engineering to train students who can take up the real-world challenges.

The undergraduate Civil Engineering programme at IIT Mandi is designed to recognize the modern pace of development in infrastructure across the world. This programme provides basic knowledge in engineering geology, construction materials, solid, fluid and soil mechanics, environmental science and engineering that helps in planning, design and construction of bridges, buildings, hydraulic structures, environmental systems, and transportation systems including highways, railways, airports etc. Along with this broad training, students are also encouraged to pursue elective courses in any specialized areas of Civil Engineering like structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, and environmental engineering. A two–semester project during the fourth year of the B.Tech programme is intended to synthesize their knowledge in selected specialized area of Civil Engineering. Students are also encouraged to take up courses from other disciplines as open electives to carry out interdisciplinary projects during their due course of the programme. The students, who are equally inclined towards other disciplines, can take the necessary courses under relevant program and get a minor.

# Objectives of the program

- To impart knowledge on application of principles of physics and mathematics, blended with modern data science, to provide solutions for common to most extraordinary problems of society.
- To train how to plan, analyse, design, execute and manage the civil engineering projects.
- To develop industry-ready manpower, who are capable to take up challenging and state-of-the-art infrastructure projects.
- To motivate the students for higher education and research to become experts in specialized fields in order to come up with innovative and economical solutions for real world problems.
