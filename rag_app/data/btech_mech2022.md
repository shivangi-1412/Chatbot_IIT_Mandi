Mechanical Engineering program at IIT Mandi

Academic courses offered by IIT-Mandi for the B.Tech./B.Tech. (Honours) program are classified as Institute Core (IC), Discipline Core (DC), Discipline Elective (DE) and Free Elective (FE) courses. Hierarchically, IC courses provide a broader view of all engineering disciplines and IIT Mandi believes in making this learning process instrumental. Here, students are conceptualized with the fundamentals of these essential courses via theoretical approach and by conducting methodically structured experiments for same. These IC courses are offered during 1st – 4th semesters of B. Tech. program.

The DC courses are focused more towards mechanical engineering subjects where the students explore core concepts in further depth. These DC courses are well structured and cover wide range of areas in mechanical engineering. They are offered between 3rd – 7th semesters of the B. Tech. program along with few IC & DE courses. From the 4th semester onwards, discipline elective (DE) courses are offered to the students giving them the option to choose from a long list of courses based on their interest; the list is presented in the latter part of this document. These course help the student gain more width into peripheral areas of mechanical engineering or attain further depth into advanced topics. In the 4th semester, students are offered with the design practicum course which is a flagship source offered by IIT Mandi. The students solve real-world engineering problems through product design and development in this practicum-based course. In this era of interdisciplinary technology, students are encouraged to credit courses apart from the core mechanical engineering subjects. These free electives (FE) are offered from the 6th semester onwards. The students have full freedom choosing and registering for the FE courses.

Interactive Socio-Technical Practicum (ISTP) is offered during the 6th semester. This course provides an opportunity for the students to explore deeper into the social problems of surrounding regions and propose socio-technical solutions to the same. The students can pursue an optional major technical project (MTP) in the final two semesters to utilize their engineering education for pursuing industry-relevant projects, with the guidance of faculty members.

In a nutshell, the mechanical engineering program of IIT Mandi offers state-of-the-art interdisciplinary education in the field, providing significant freedom to the candidates to pursue ancillary interests with options of minor degrees. With the vision of training the future mechanical engineers of India, the Mechanical Engineering program of IIT Mandi is designed, and regularly updated, to ensure that the students stay top on the technology and are ready to take up the challenges of the future.
