Bachelor of Science in Chemical Sciences

School of Chemical Sciences (SCS)

# 1.1. Preamble of the Program

The discipline of Chemical Sciences as an integral part of Basic Sciences serves as the basis of critical developments for value-added chemicals, pharmaceuticals, novel materials, understanding biological processes, and establishing the theoretical basis of natural phenomena. The 4-Year BS program can be extended for one more year to complete BS-MS program, which is for 5 years. The 4-year BS with an optional 1-year MS program (BS-MS) in Chemical Sciences is designed to prepare graduates with a strong foundation in fundamental Chemistry along with Engineering for today’s research and technology-driven world. The program creates a perfect harmony between Chemistry and Engineering branches by bridging the gap between chemical, physical, mathematical, computational, data, and engineering sciences. Particularly, owing to the “true” cross-disciplinary nature of the program, it can help advance the knowledge ranging from atomic-level understanding of the chemical and biochemical phenomena to designing and developing new molecules, materials, and devices. As the barrier between Basic Sciences and Engineering is fast disappearing with modern innovations and their applications, the BS program in Chemical Sciences can perfectly inculcate the young minds in academia to develop and deploy chemistry-based technologies for the modern world.

# 1.2. Objective of the Program

The major objective of this program is to train the graduates with fundamental concepts of both Chemistry and Engineering, thereby, equipping them for taking up diverse roles in industry and academia. The program particularly aims at training young minds to creatively think about research and innovation at a very early stage through a diverse range of hands-on projects. The perfect fusion of chemistry and engineering along with specializations and minors in different branches is the goal that will prepare the students for industry and academia and motivate them toward research and innovation.

# 1.3. Uniqueness of the Program

The BS program offers specialization in chemistry branches, minors in engineering and humanities branches, and is highly research-oriented, which makes the program one of its kind. Particularly, it offers,

Option for specialization in major chemistry branches, organic, inorganic, physical, and material chemistry prough discipline elective courses in pe 3rd and 4p year of BS.
Option for minors in different branches including Computer Science Engineering, Communication Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Measurement and Instrumentation, Management, German Language, etc.

Due to the research-oriented nature of the program, the graduates get good exposure to research in the desired area as early as in their 4th year of the BS program. Thus, the program presents a unique opportunity for graduates to pursue a research career just after completing the BS.

# 1.4. Placement Prospects

The BS Chemical Sciences program graduates will have placement opportunities in various chemical, pharmaceutical, and technology industries. In addition, if one completes MS program (BS-MS, 5 year), they will have opportunity to pursue a research career in a specialized field.
