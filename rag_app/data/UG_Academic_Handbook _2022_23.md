|P|0| |Passed the course; however, the credits earned will not be counted for the SGPA/CGPA calculations.|

I Grade: The I-grade indicates a temporary grade and that a small part of the total requirement of the course remains to be completed and that the student has done satisfactory work in all other aspects of the course. The student is required to complete this small part within a prescribed date, generally within one month of the start of the following regular semester, and the course instructor will amend the I-grade to a regular grade within this period. If the conversion to a regular grade is not done within one month of the start of the following regular semester, the I-grade will be automatically converted to an F grade.

P Grade: see section 4.4

# 2.5 | Evaluation of Performance

# 2.5.1 | SGPA

The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by SGPA, which is a weighted average of the grades in all the courses done by the student in the given semester. The SGPA is calculated as follows:

Where,

ci = credits in a course i
---
# Chapter 2. Course Structure, Credit System & Evaluation

2.5. Evaluation of Performance

SGPA = Σci gi;

gi = grade point obtained in course i

n = all registered courses in the semester

The Semester GPA calculation shall include 'F' grade.

2.5.2 | CGPA

The performance up to any time in the course of the student’s program is indicated by
the student’s CGPA, which is also calculated by the formula used for SGPA calculation,
except that the averaging is done over all of the courses and credits that the student has
taken during his/her entire program up to that point.
The intermediate CGPA calculation (i.e. CGPA calculated during the course of the program before completion) shall also include 'F' grade, except for those cases where the course has been successfully cleared in a subsequent attempt or has been replaced by an equivalent course that has been successfully completed.
Note: courses registered under P/F category are not included while calculating the SGPA and CGPA.

2.5.3 | Grade Sheet (semester)

The grade sheet issued at the end of a semester to each student will contain the following:

- The course number, course name and the credits for each course registered in that semester.
- The letter grade obtained in each course

- The Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA, see 2.f.i) for that particular semester
- The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA, see 2.f.ii) of all the courses taken from the first semester

At the end of the program, a final Transcript containing details of all the courses taken by the student mentioning the overall CGPA will be issued along with the Degree certificate.

The record of the F grade(s) obtained for a course will be retained in the Grade Sheets and final Transcript.

2.5.4 | Final CGPA on degree

The final CGPA, calculated upon the completion of all credit requirements towards the fulfillment of a degree, shall include all credits earned against a letter grade, including those credits that are in excess of the minimum requirements. The final CGPA calculation shall not include any 'F' grade once all the earned credit requirements are completed, (including the minimum credit requirement per basket such as IC/ DC/ DE/ FE/ ODE etc), in continuation of the existing provision

2.6 | Results & Re-evaluation

2.6.1 | Method of Awarding Grades

A final meeting of the Class Committee without the student representatives will be convened within seven days after the last day of the end semester examination. The letter grades to be awarded to the students for different courses will be finalised in such meetings.

2.6.2 | Declaring the results

After finalisation by the Class Committee, the course instructor will submit the letter-grades awarded to the students in a course to the academic office in prescribed format.

2.6.3 | Re-evaluation of Answer Papers

If a student has grievances about the result of a particular course, he/she can contact
the concerned course instructor within one week from the commencement of the regular semester immediately following the announcement of the results. If the course instructor feels that the case is genuine, he/she may re-examine the case and submit a revised grade, if applicable. Any request to reconsider the grade after one week of the start of the subsequent regular semester will not be considered.

The course instructor will return answer scripts to the students after evaluation, as part of the learning process. If any student does not collect his/her answer script by the 1st week of the subsequent regular semester, the course instructor may discard it.

2.7 | Supplementary Examination

• A student who earns an F grade in a Core course must secure a pass grade in pat course.
• A student who gets “F” grade in a Core course is eligible to seek a Supplementary Examination in a subsequent semester to clear pe backlog, provided he/she satisfies pe minimum attendance criteria of pe course. For taking such Supplementary Examination, pe student need not attend classes of pat course again.
• A student is eligible for only one Supplementary Examination in a course to clear pe backlog. In case a student fails in pe Supplementary Examination, he/she has to register for pat course again in a regular semester/vacation semester and repeat pe course by attending regular classes and exams.
• The Supplementary Examination may be offered by pe same instructor who offered pe course earlier or pe instructor who offers pe course in pe current semester.
• The Supplementary Examination can be held along wip pe regular students of pe subsequent semesters or during pe make-up exam slots of pe subsequent semesters or at pe convenience of pe course instructor.
• Generally, pe end semester exam alone is given as pe Supplementary Examination and pe sessional marks (i.e. quiz marks etc.) earned by pe student in pe original semester will be taken into account for calculating pe final marks. The grade cut-off used in pe original semester shall be used for finalizing pe grade.

# Semesters & Registration

3.1 | Academic Calendar and Semester system

Each academic session is divided into two regular semesters of approximately eighteen weeks duration (with at least seventy working days for classes in each semester): an Odd Semester (normally August-November) and an Even Semester (normally February-June). Further, there are two vacation semesters (Winter & Summer) of nearly 8-10 weeks duration as well.

3.2 | Enrolment

- From the second semester onwards, all students will have to report and register/enroll on a day specified in the Academic Calendar at the beginning of the semester. A student will be eligible for enrolment only if he/she satisfies the conditions under &lt;R.11&gt; and will be permitted to enroll only if he/she has cleared all dues to the institute up to the end of the previous semester, provided he/she is not debarred from enrolment, on disciplinary grounds.
- If a student fails to report on the specified date, he/she may be allowed by the Dean (Academics) to enroll within one week from the reporting date with a fine. The amount of fine will be specified from time to time.
- Under exceptional circumstances, a student may be allowed to enroll after one week of enrollment date with permission from Chairperson, Senate through Faculty Adviser and Dean (Academics).
---
# Chapter 3. Semesters & Registration

# 3.3. Registration (Pre-registration)

Except for the first semester, course pre-registration for other semesters will be done during a specified week before the end-semester examination of the previous semester. Pre-registration is to be done through an online portal of the office automation system (OAS) of the institute. Students should have successfully completed the courses of (n-4)th semester to register for courses in nth semester. For example, to register for courses in 5th, 6th, 7th & 8th semesters of B. Tech. program, the student should have successfully completed all the courses of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th semesters respectively, as prescribed in the curriculum of the concerned branch of study.

Students who have backlog courses under (n-4) rule; the registration of courses shall be restricted to the average credit clearance capacity in the last two semesters. The student must register for the backlog courses first giving priority to the oldest backlogs.

The semester used by a student to clear only the backlog course(s), will not be treated as effective for reckoning the number of semesters spent by the student with respect to the maximum permissible limit (R.12)

# 3.4. Course Add/Drop

If a student wants to modify the pre-registered courses, he/she may do so by adding or dropping courses after the start of the semester within the course add or drop deadline mentioned in the Academic Calendar with the approval of Faculty Adviser and the concerned course instructors. However, the student should ensure that the total number of credits registered in any semester should enable him/her to earn the minimum number of credit requirements as specified under R.3.5 and R.11.1.

# 3.5. Summer/Winter Vacation Semesters

The summer/winter vacation semester courses will be offered to clear the backlog courses of the students and for students who wish to spend a semester off-campus based on the availability of the course instructors.

No student should register for more than three vacation semester courses during a particular vacation semester.
---
# Chapter 3. Semesters & Registration

3.6. Semester Break/Temporary Withdrawal

- A student has to pay a fee for each credit registered in the vacation semester.
- The assessment procedure for a course will be similar to that of a regular semester course. Withdrawal from a vacation semester course is not permitted.

3.6 | Semester Break/Temporary Withdrawal

A student may be permitted by the Dean (Academics) to obtain semester break or temporary withdrawal from the program for a semester or longer duration for reasons of ill health or other valid reasons. Normally, a student will be permitted to withdraw from the program only for a maximum continuous or intermittent period of two semesters during the whole program duration.

3.7 | Attendance

- Generally, the minimum attendance requirement of a course is 70%. However, a course instructor can have a different criterion for his/her course. In such a case, the changed criteria should be announced to the students at the beginning of the course. It should also be announced in the 1st Class Committee meeting and recorded in the minutes. The percentage of attendance in a course will be indicated in the grade sheet by a letter code as below:

|Attendance|Rounded|Remarks|Code|
|---|---|---|---|
|to 92 to 100 %| |Very Good|VG|
|80 to 92 %| |Good|G|
|70 to 80 %| |Satisfactory|S|
|&lt; 70 %| |Poor|P|

- A student who has an attendance lower than the required minimum attendance in a course, whatsoever the reason for the shortfall in attendance, will not be permitted to appear in the end-semester examination of the course. His/her registration for that course will be treated as cancelled, and he/she shall be awarded ‘F’ grade in that course.

- The internship must be done in a technology oriented public/private sector company/industry or in reputed research organisations, such as CSIR, DRDO or BARC. Internships in IIT Mandi or other educational institutions will not be considered for this purpose.
- Internships with start-up companies, which are not registered yet, will not be considered.
- On successful completion of the Internship, two credits will be awarded to the student for the same. These credits will not be counted towards SGPA/CGPA calculations.

4.4 | Pass/Fail courses

Students can also take a few course credits as Pass/Fail grade towards the degree requirements of the students. Such courses can be independent study courses, research based academic or industrial projects and courses offered by on-line platforms supported through Government of India initiatives like SWAYAM/NPTEL etc. A Pass (P) or Fail (F) grade will be awarded for such courses. These courses will not count towards the SGPA/CGPA calculations.

The above credits under the P/F category shall be optional and any P/F credits taken by students beyond the prescribed limit (see the table below) will not contribute towards their degree requirements. However, it would reflect on their transcripts. As a consequence of these changes, the semester internship of UG/dual degree students will also count as 9 credits of Free Elective.

|Program|Maximum prescribed limit of the number of credits|
|---|---|
|BTech|9 credits (FE)|
|BTech with Honors|9 credits (FE)|
|Integrated BTech-MTech Dual Degree|12 credits (FE)|

# Rules governing Change or Addition to the Programme

5.1 Branch Change

The guidelines for change of branch are as follows:

- To be considered for a branch change, a student needs to submit the application before the end of the second semester of the programme, with choices in order of preference, of the branch or branches desired to be changed to
- Branch change applications will be considered strictly in order of merit as established by the CGPA of first-year courses (excluding HSS elective) to the extent of the applicant’s choices in the order of the preference. If a seat opens up at any later stage in the process, it be offered to the applicant with the highest CGPA by going back up the list

- During the branch change process, if any tie of CGPA scores, the affected students will be treated equally and will be jointly given the branch change subject to condition (iii) above
---
# Chapter 5. Rules governing Change or Addition to the Programme

# 5.2. Honours

B.Tech. (Honours) students can register for additional courses from the Discipline Elective basket over and above the courses prescribed in the regular B.Tech. curriculum from the 5th semester onwards in consultation with the Faculty Adviser. Students who have registered for B.Tech. (Honours) are permitted to register for more than 22 credits in a semester.

# 5.3. Minor

- A minor is intended for a student to gain expertise in an area outside his/her major B.Tech. discipline. A specialist basket of at least 3 courses is identified for each Minor. Such course baskets may rest on one or more foundation courses. A basket may have sequences within it, i.e. advanced courses may rest on basic courses in the basket. In order to successfully complete a Minor, a student needs to take at least 9 credits with a CGPA of 7.0 out of the courses defined in that Minor basket.
- The area of the Minor must be different from the Major discipline of the student; the courses that are part of the Common Core (including HSS), or the Discipline Core/Electives cannot be counted towards a Minor. However, the 5 credits earned under Humanities Electives (see R.3.7) may be counted for Minor requirements if needed.
- A student is allowed to take any number of Minors, but a particular course cannot be counted for more than 1 Minors.
- The name of the Minor will appear on the Transcript and the degree certificate of the student

# 5.4. Semester exchange

IIT Mandi has memorandum of understanding (MoU) for semester exchange visits with some eminent academic institutions in India and abroad. Selection of candidates for such exchange visits will be done through a competitive process.
---
# Chapter 5. Rules governing Change or Addition to the Programme

# 5.5. Double Major

- Selected students can go on exchange visit for one or two semesters. If the student goes on semester exchange visits for two semesters, these two semesters can be contiguous.
- No student exchange visit will be allowed during the final (normally eighth) semester.
- Some of the signature courses of IIT Mandi (Reverse Engineering, Design Practicum, ISTP, and any others that are notified from time to time) must be completed at IIT Mandi. This is so as to preserve the character of IIT Mandi B.Tech. degree
- The semester exchange programs can only be undertaken with those institutes with whom IIT Mandi has an MoU for such visits.
- Credits and grades earned during semester exchange visits will be converted to IIT Mandi equivalent credits and grades as per the Senate approved conversion criteria in each case.

# Double Major

Under this option, the student will be able to major in a secondary branch, along with a BTech (or dual degree – BTech+MTech) in their primary branch (which the student got during selection at IIT Mandi / after branch change). For this the student will be required to complete additional coursework, which will include core and elective courses, in the secondary discipline. An additional one year, typically, will be permitted for the student to complete these additional requirements. A degree certificate stating B.Tech. (or Btech+MTech) in &lt;ABC&gt; with second Major in &lt;XYZ&gt; shall be awarded. This is practised at three other IITs as of date, including IIT Kanpur, IIT Gandhinagar and IIT Hyderabad. The double major program can be termed as a 5-year program just as usual BTech is termed as a 4-year program.

Note:

- A double major is not a dual degree (BTech + MTech).
- Double major is not a double degree (two BTechs). This is because the requirements of a second BTech degree (53 credits) would also include a second B.Tech. project, and is much more than that of the proposed second major (36-40 credits).

# 5.5. Double Major

# 5.5.1 Application

- Eligibility criteria: CGPA 7.0, not more than one F grade. If someone is struggling with the parent branch, a double major will be an added pressure.
- Application period:
- At the end of 4th and 6th semester for four-year BTech programs. Applications will be considered subject to the availability of seats in the program.
- At the end of 6th and 8th semester for five-year BTech+MTech dual degree programs. Applications will be considered subject to the availability of seats in the program.
- In case the number of applicants exceeds the number of available vacancies, the process of selection into the second major shall be determined by a faculty committee constituted by the Dean academics for this purpose.
- The Dean (Academics) shall decide a cap on the maximum number of students who can avail this option for any particular (second) discipline, based on the advice tendered by the respective Schools/PFG Chairs.
- Student applications must be recommended by the Faculty Advisor.
- The PFG chair of the second major will have to approve the student’s request for entry and the application can be denied in case the seats are full, the student has any F grade in any core/elective course of the second major or some other valid reason.

# 5.5.2 Courses/Baskets

- A basket of courses that contribute towards the second major is identified by the PFG of each (second) discipline, that may comprise some combination of discipline core and discipline elective courses from the second discipline. The PFG of the (second) discipline may also list an additional set of prerequisite courses in some cases. A minimum number of core credits may be decided for all second majors.
- Between 36 and 40 credits from this basket need to be completed by the student.
- For the purpose of completion of the 36-40 credits required for the second major, a maximum of 12 FE credits may be used from the parent program. The remaining

# Chapter 5. Rules governing Change or Addition to the Programme

5.5. Double Major

- FE credits from the parent program should be applied towards courses that do not count towards the second major basket requirement.
- Students may start accumulating course credits in the form of additional courses (even before they officially enroll into a Double Major program) and convert them to be counted in favor of Double Major requirements at the time of enrolling into this program. This will help them learn the disciplines gradually over the five years and also reduce load on the administration while offering courses to the students without clashes.
- Courses that are a part of the common core (including HSS)/Discipline Core/Discipline Elective for a student’s parent discipline cannot count towards their second Major requirement.
- If a core/foundation course of second discipline Y is a part of parent program X’s discipline core/elective:
- Eg:- DSE student wants to second major in CSE.
- “CS202 - Data Structures & Algorithm” is a discipline core for both CSE and DSE.
- Solution: Compensation of such credits can be done through:
- Possible replacements (from a pool of courses), suggested by PFG of the second discipline
- Courses that count as DE for the second discipline Y

5.5.3 | Pass/Fail rules

The enrollment into a second major shall not influence the Pass/Fail credit requirements of the parent discipline. However, it may be noted that none of the courses that count towards the second major may be taken under the Pass/Fail category

5.5.4 | Completing the program

Only one CGPA will be reported on all official documents, calculated upon the performance of the student in all courses credited, including the requirement of BTech and second major. The overall grade report, in addition to the primary discipline courses, will also display the discipline of the second Major and courses done to complete the second Major along with the grades awarded.

# Chapter 5. Rules governing Change or Addition to the Programme

# 5.5. Double Major

Voluntary opting-out from the program is not allowed.

# 5.5.5 | Termination of the program

- After enrolling into a double major program, if a student gets an "F" grade in two or more than two courses, his/her enrollment to the double major program will be terminated.
- The second Major part of the program will be automatically discontinued at the end of the tenth semester for BTechs and 12th semester for BTech+MTech Dual degree students if the student is not able to complete the requirements of double major. Special requests can be considered by the Dean Academics on the recommendation of the PFG chair of the Second major discipline.
- In the case of termination, the courses which were credited for completion of the second major basket can be counted towards the Free Electives (if required).

# 5.5.6 | Felicitation and Awards

The double major program is a 5-year UG program. Hence, the following is proposed:

Foundation Day A program-wise award for outstanding academic excellence will be given at the 4th year for the students seeking Double Major in addition to a 4-year BTech degree, based on their parent program.

Convocation Four-year BTech students enrolled in the Double major program admitted into the institute in year x compete with 4-year BTech students admitted in year x + 1 for the following medals:

- President of India Gold Medal
- Institute Silver Medals
- Rani Gonsalves Memorial Medal
- Balasundaram Endowment Prize in German
- Director’s Gold medal

# 5.5.7 | CnP rules

BTech students doing double major will be allowed to sit for placements in the 5th year, not 4th. BTech + MTech dual degree students will be allowed to sit in the placements in the 6th year, not 5th. CnP will have the final say in any case.

5.5.8 | Implementation

The following types of programs can be taken as second major:

• All engineering programs (CE, ME, CSE etc.)
• Science programs (Maps, Physics, Chemistry etc.)
• Engineering science (EP)

5.5.9 | Other important notes

- The B.Tech. (Honours) program will only be applicable to the parent Major discipline, and not the second Major discipline. Furthermore, no waiver of Free Elective credits shall be provided to the student, in order to remain consistent with the pre-existing B.Tech. (Honours) requirement.
- A student cannot undertake a second Major and minor in the same discipline.
- Internship rules (including the time of internship) shall be the same as that for the regular B.Tech. program.
- Timely completion of the course and credit requirements will solely be the students’ responsibility.
- For students doing Double Major with BTech Honours, the R.29.4 of BTech Ordinances and Regulations would apply only to 172-174 credits done from the parent discipline and not on the 36-40 credits counting towards the second major, i.e. it’s the GPA of Parent programme courses which needs to be 8.5 or more and not the overall CGPA.

5.6 | Dual Degree

The provision of B. Tech (Honours) to B. Tech - M. Tech Dual Degree encloses the following:

• To be at par wip R 29.1 students need to do extra 12 credits of discipline electives. This means pey have to earn 218 instead of 206 credits for pe award of pe B.Tech (Hons.) degree.

However, to earn a B.Tech (Honours) they are still required to do DP-301P: Interactive Socio-Technical Practicum (ISTP) and obtain a minimum grade of ‘B’ in it. These 4 credits of Interactive Socio-Technical Practicum (ISTP) can come from 22 credits of free electives contributing to 4 out of 22 credits allotted for free electives. Also, the students have to earn a minimum of ‘B’ grade in the PGP.

Students should not have received ‘F’ grade throughout the IDD program.

# Conduct and Discipline

Every student is required to observe discipline and decorous behaviour both inside and outside the campus and not to indulge in any activity which will bring down the prestige of the Institute.

Any act of indiscipline by a student shall be referred to a Students’ Welfare & Discipline Committee (SWDC). The Committee shall enquire into the charges and recommend suitable punishment if the charges are substantiated. Dean (Academics) will consider the recommendations for minor punishments and warnings and take appropriate action accordingly. In case of major punishment, the Senate will take appropriate decisions.

Appeal: The student may appeal against the disciplinary action to the Chairperson, Senate, whose decision will be final in such matters.

Ragging of any dimension is a criminal and non-bailable offence in our country. The current State and Central legislations provide for stringent punishment, including imprisonment. Once the involvement of a student is established in ragging, the offending student will be dismissed from the institute and will not be readmitted. Avenues also exist for collective punishment, if individuals cannot be identified in this inhuman act. Every student of the institute, along with his/her parents, shall give an undertaking at the time of admission in this regard.
