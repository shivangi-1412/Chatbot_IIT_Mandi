B. Tech. in Materials Science and Engineering

School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (SMME)

# Program Description:

The Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Materials Science and Engineering program aims to achieve a strong foundation in Materials Science with a focus on Engineering Applications by offering a large number of allied engineering courses and employable skills. The idea is to develop a broad B.Tech. Curriculum with a blend of science and engineering covering key elements of materials, advanced processing, additive manufacturing with hands-on training. Further, the proposed curriculum will develop an understanding of the structure-properties correlation, processing, and service behavior of engineering materials, including semiconductors for electronic devices, ceramics for energy conversion and storage, and polymers for emerging biotechnologies. This understanding fosters both the development of new materials and the improvement of existing materials to optimize manufactured products and modern tools. This program will give students a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical understanding of the subject. At present scenario, students who specialize in materials science and engineering need to study and develop solutions in the advanced emerging fields of sustainability and renewable energy, nanotechnology, quantum materials, and devices, artificial intelligence, smart materials, low-power computing, manufacturing, and productivity. We have excellent laboratories/research centers facilities for materials science and engineering at IIT Mandi. The proposed B.Tech. program will help us to bridge the gaps between the research activities and engineering education, and our graduates would play a leadership role in future growth and the industry. Materials engineers also offer knowledge of materials for practical applications that serve as the cornerstone of the goods and services provided by numerous sectors. Further, the proposed B.Tech. program will promote the academic and research activities at IIT Mandi and make larger impacts in society by producing high-quality engineers.

# Brief details about the Elective Specializations are shown below.

# 1. B.Tech. Specialization in Product Design and Manufacturing

To establish a program bridging a gap between industrial product design and its manufacturing.
The program minor will be oriented towards conceptualizing and nurturing a design idea by
making it progress through various design stages. The outcome of such a practice will be a
product prototype that can be upscaled to an industrial level. The students opting for this minor
will aim at working in close collaboration with the incubation center (catalyst) to support the
technology transfer and/or lead to the establishment of the start-ups. Such a program will be in
line with the Make-in-India objective. The engineering students, irrespective of their branch can
engage themselves right from the first semester into a design philosophy which they can slowly
nurture over the years ending up with a ready to launch a product by the end of their
undergraduate degree.

# 2. B.Tech. Specialization in Clean Energy and Sustainable Materials

Materials that can be produced at a large scale in an eco-friendly manner and a reduced
dependence on non-renewable sources are designated as sustainable materials. The idea of
sustainable materials and production is an emerging concept in the 21st century that is inspired
by the rapid global growth in the production of commercial goods featuring advanced
functionalities. Sustainable materials are expected to be compatible with low energy consuming
manufacturing processes that generate minimal waste. At the same time, their recyclability is
an essential aspect, in order to minimize waste generation. In this specialization, courses on a
range of environment-friendly materials, non-hazardous materials, waste-derived materials,
recyclable and biodegradable materials, and associated process optimization will be offered.
The student will also receive training on designing and developing alternative materials for
existing products. In addition, general waste management processes, introduction to energy
management and associated technologies will be covered. Essential energy and environment
related policies, both Indian and international, will also be touched upon.

# 3. B.Tech. Specialization in Quantum Materials and Semiconductor Devices

The advancement of the human civilization has been immensely influenced by the discovery of
new materials. Almost all the new technological developments rely on the exotic properties of
materials. Materials such as Magnets, Multiferroics, Thermoelectrics, Optical, Piezoelectrics,
superconductors, nanomaterial, low dimensional materials etc. whose properties cannot be
explained within the pursuit of Newtonian physics, and the principles of quantum mechanics
are invoked to understand their behavior, are termed as quantum materials. The technology
---
Using new quantum materials would lead to the next level of revolution in technologies for energy, electronic sensors, quantum computers, optical fiber, optical sensors, levitating trains, nano-electronics, information infrastructures etc. The new technology harnessing the quantum properties of materials is expected to be more powerful in comparison to its classical counterparts. In order to harness the quantum properties of materials for the future technology, there is need to understand, explore and tailor the new property of material as well as the fabrication of the suitable devices. The proposed minor in B.Tech. program will give an early exposure to the students to this developing field of advance technology.

4. B.Tech. Specialization in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering

The integrated computational materials engineering covering variety of theoretical and simulation approaches at different length scales with the use of different computational tools would attract students who are interested to apply their computational skills to scientific problems in Materials Science. In addition to conventional methods such as density functional theory, molecular dynamics, modeling and simulations and finite element methods, emerging subjects like application of AI and machine learning in materials science would be introduced. Materials discovery has always been challenging problem based on its numerous real life target applications. Scientist are trying to accelerate the research with use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to adapt the materials fabrication which could meet the demand of current century. Students will be trained in multiple computational packages to solve materials engineering problems from atomic, molecular scales to macroscopic length scales.
