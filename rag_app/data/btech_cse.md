Preamble to the program

Traditionally computer science curricula have drawn from diverse fields. These include (amongst others) the study of digital circuits, devices, and their aggregation into functioning machines; the principles and paradigms of programming and data structures; the mathematical foundations and models of computing and notions of computability; scientific computing and large software applications in technology development and industry; human computer interaction with two way communication via speech, language, images, touch and gestures; logical reasoning and problem solving systems; networks and distributed computing paradigms; handling large databases and dealing with vast amounts of data on the world wide web; machine learning and systems that improve their performance with experience; interactive multimodal systems for entertainment and education.

While it stands to reason the focus and strength of a discipline depends directly upon core curriculum that a computer science graduate should have been exposed to. This expectation can arise out of three sources – industry that the graduate might go to for employment, a post-graduate school for research and development, or an entrepreneurial streak in the student.

The Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) BTech curriculum follows the ideas a “theory course” should be preceded by a “practicum module” in which the students are exposed to development with existing systems, where possible. It is hoped that this will lead to greater appreciation of the theoretical issues dealt with in the course, and at the same time encourage the students for more hands-on development work. This is in line with the approach where the students plunge into an area early and catch up with other needed courses later. The curriculum is designed based on the ACM/IEEE Task Force recommendations for CS curricula.

In the current CSE curriculum, theory course Information and Database Systems in 4th semester is preceded by the practicum course Applied Database Practicum in 3rd semester. The practicum course on software engineering, Large Application Practicum is followed by the elective theory course related to Software Engineering. Originally the theory course Introduction to Computing and Distributed Processes is preceded by the practicum course System Practicum. Recently this is revised and now practicum course System Practicum precedes the theory course Introduction to Computing and Distributed Processes.

Objectives of the program

During the last two decades, there has been a major paradigm shift in processing, communication, and storage of information from predominantly analog domain to digital domain for the reasons such as ease of implementation, better efficiency, greater robustness against noise, and enhanced performance and security. This shift has not only resulted in generation of ever increasing volumes of digital data but also an acute need to efficiently process, store, and communicate it. To address this need the focus of CSE curriculum must shift from introducing the traditional elementary courses to represent and process the data to more abstract structures. This will enable the students to better understand and appreciate the current developments at the frontiers of CSE, both in theory and application, and prepare them to contribute to further advancement of such frontiers.
